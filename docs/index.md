    Visibility:

      @UmlExcludeSuperTypes - excludes the listed supertypes from all diagrams
          @UmlExcludeMember - excludes the annotated member
          @UmlIncludeMember - includes the annotated member, even if it wouldn't normally be included

               @UmlRelation - adds a labeled UML relation from the enclosing type to the annotated member type
            @UmlAggregation - adds a UML aggregation association from the enclosing type to the annotated field type
